## Goals

As the principal developer behind PDF4QT, I have set the following goals for the project:

- To create a robust foss pdf editor alternative to **commercial PDF editors**, opening up advanced PDF editing capabilities to all.
- To offer licensing terms that are more flexible than GPL or AGPL, making PDF4QT a suitable choice for both open-source enthusiasts and commercial users.
- To harness **modern C++** features and the power of **multicore CPUs**, delivering a highly efficient PDF editing experience.
- To ensure PDF4QT is inclusive and accessible, supporting applications on both Windows and Linux platforms.
- I'm actively working towards the full integration of the standard **PDF 2.0** to stay on top of the latest developments in PDF technology. While this is a work in progress, my commitment to this goal is unwavering.
- Recognizing the increasing prevalence of high-resolution monitors, I'm dedicated to ensuring PDF4QT supports 4K/8K monitors (high DPI devices) for a visually stunning user experience.
